# Note!

Code listed isn't necessarily complete or a usable product. The point is that the resource linked is mostly code and code that a beginner with a grasp of the basics could learn something from.

# My stuff

- https://github.com/bitemyapp/bloodhound Elasticsearch, mostly datatypes to describe Elasticsearch's query API and JSON parsing/generation.

- https://github.com/bitemyapp/blacktip Distributed k-ordered unique id service. Directly mimicking Flake which was itself based on Snowflake. Not correct/safe as I'm not using the system's monotonic clock.


# Users that write code people should learn from

- https://github.com/michaelxavier

- https://github.com/nikita-volkov somewhat advanced but pokes some interesting stuff


# File operations

- https://gist.github.com/twopoint718/cac0bbe52fd5f0d3b1be Enumerates files in a directory and organizes them by file extension

- https://gist.github.com/bitemyapp/2311fcbfa152ce0980ed Filewriter example from the Haskell.org wiki I believe


# Web apps

- https://github.com/bitemyapp/shawty-prime This URL shortener written in Scotty is explained in detail in [Haskell Programming](http://haskellbook.com)

- https://github.com/thoughtbot/carnival Yesod app. Sort of an open source clone of Disqus.
