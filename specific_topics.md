# Specific topics for Haskell users

### What does that `<-` / `do` / list comprehension syntactic sugar do?

Excellent [article](http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/10/how-to-desugar-haskell-code.html).

### For understanding list and fold

- [Explain List Folds to Yourself](http://vimeo.com/64673035)

### For learning some common typeclasses

Useful for understanding `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, `Monoid` and other
typeclasses in general but also some Hask-specific category theory:

- The [Typeclassopedia](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia)

# Laziness, strictness, guarded recursion

- Heinrich Apfelmus' article series at https://hackhands.com/guide-lazy-evaluation-haskell/ is excellent.

- Marlow's [book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/ch02.html)
  about parallelism and concurrency has one of the best introductions to
  laziness and normal form I've found. Use other material too if it doesn't
  stick immediately.

- [Oh my laziness!](http://alpmestan.com/posts/2013-10-02-oh-my-laziness.html)

- SO question '[Does haskell have laziness?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13042353/does-haskell-have-tail-recursive-optimization)'

- [Johan Tibell](https://github.com/tibbe)'s slides from a talk on
  [reasoning about laziness](http://www.slideshare.net/tibbe/reasoning-about-laziness).

## Brief demonstration

```haskell
let a = 1 : a -- guarded recursion, (:) is lazy and can be pattern matched.
let (v : _) = a
> v
1
> head a -- head a == v
1

let a = 1 * a -- not guarded, (*) is strict
> a
*** Exception: <<loop>>
```

# Monads and monad transformers

> Do not do these until you understand typeclasses, Monoid, Functor, and
> Applicative!

Implement the standard library monads ( List, Maybe, Cont, Error, Reader,
Writer, State ) for yourself to understand them better. Then maybe write an
monadic interpreter for a small expression language using
[Monad Transformers Step by Step](http://catamorph.de/documents/Transformers.pdf)
paper (mentioned in 'monad transformers' below).

Writing many interpreters by just changing the monad to change the semantics can
help convey what's going on.

- [This talk](https://vimeo.com/73648150) by Tony excellently motivates monad
  transformers, [the slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7810909/talks/monad-transformers/cbaa991e0eb49224eb286c1e418e2b9828e1fb21/monad-transformers.pdf).

Also, reimplement `Control.Monad`. Functions like `mapM` or `sequence` are good
opportunities to practice writing generic monadic code.

The Data61 course can be used as a guide to this process, which will also involve
writing your own Applicative as well.

# Working with Cabal

## Cabal guidelines

Cabal Hell was a problem for Haskell users before the introduction of
sandboxes. Installing outside of a sandbox will install into your user
package-db. This is *not* a good idea except for foundational packages like
Cabal, alex, and happy. Nothing else should be installed in the user or global
package-dbs unless you know what you're doing.

Some best practices for avoiding cabal hell are available
[here](http://softwaresimply.blogspot.com/2014/07/haskell-best-practices-for-avoiding.html).

To experiment with a package or start a project, begin by doing
`cabal sandbox init` in a new directory.

Put briefly:

- Always use sandboxes for installing new packages, building new or existing
  projects, or starting experiments

- Use `cabal repl` to start a project-scoped ghci instance

The sandbox-based approach I suggest should avoid package-dependency problems,
but it's incompatible with the way the Haskell Platform provides pre-built
packages. If you're still learning Haskell and don't understand how ghc-pkg and
Cabal work, *avoid platform* and instead use the install instructions earlier in
the guide.

## Stackage

For any users (usually Yesod users) that have build problems, consider Stackage.

- A good summary of Stackage is
  [here](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2014/05/stackage-server).

In the author's opinion, Stackage is usually more useful than `cabal freeze`.

# Hoogle and Haddock

## Search code by type signature

The [Hoogle search engine](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) can search by type.

For example, look at the search results for `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`
[here](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=%28a+-%3E+b%29+-%3E+%5ba%5d+-%3E+%5bb%5d).

Also hosted by fpcomplete [here](https://www.fpcomplete.com/hoogle).

Also [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html) (which has all of
hackage enabled for search by default).

## Setting up your own local instance of Hoogle

Take a look [here](https://gist.github.com/bitemyapp/3e6a015760775e0679bf).

## Haddock

1. [Fix your hackage documentation](http://fuuzetsu.co.uk/blog/posts/2014-01-06-Fix-your-Hackage-documentation.html)

2. [Hackage documentation v2](http://fuuzetsu.co.uk/blog/posts/2014-01-06-Hackage-documentation-v2.html)

Note that these posts are *slightly out of date*: for example, now Hackage sports
shiny new info with documentation info and build status.

## What you really need to know

In order to have haddocks include documentation for related packages, you have
to set `documentation: True` in your `~/.cabal/config`. If it was left on the
default (`False`) or set to `False`, you'll have to delete all your packages and
reinstall before generating haddocks.

The other thing to keep in mind is that due to the way the `$pkg` parameter gets
interpolated *by* cabal, not by you, the `html-location` and `content-location`
parameters *must be in single quotes* and entered into a shell or contained in a
shell script. They will not work in a Makefile, because it will think they are
Make variables!

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env sh

# You can write it one one line by skipping the backslashes
cabal haddock --hoogle --hyperlink-source                       \
 --html-location='http://hackage.haskell.org/package/$pkg/docs' \
 --contents-location='http://hackage.haskell.org/package/$pkg'
```

# TravisCI

If you're as big a fan of [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) as I am, then I
*strongly* recommend you take a look at
[multi-ghc-travis](https://github.com/hvr/multi-ghc-travis) by as the basis of
the `travis.yml` for your Haskell projects.

# Frontend/JavaScript

We have an embarrassment of riches! There are three main choices I would
recommend:

* [Haste](http://haste-lang.org/) a Haskell to JavaScript compiler
  - The [compiler](https://github.com/valderman/haste-compiler) on github.
  - An excellent
    [demo](http://www.airpair.com/haskell/posts/haskell-tutorial-introduction-to-web-apps)
    of Haste with an example project.

* [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)
  - [GHCJS Introduction](http://weblog.luite.com/wordpress/?p=14)
  - [Functional Reactive Web Interfaces with GHCJS and Sodium](http://weblog.luite.com/wordpress/?p=127)
  - [Writing Atom plugins in Haskell using ghcjs ](http://edsko.net/2015/02/14/atom-haskell/)

* [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)
  - Not strictly Haskell like Haste and GHCJS, but a popular choice among
    Haskellers
  - Written in and inspired by haskell
  - Try purescript in you browser [here](http://try.purescript.org/)
  - Great guide for [getting started](http://www.christopherbiscardi.com/2014/06/22/getting-started-with-purescript/)

## Which frontend language do I use?

GHCJS and Haste are both fully Haskell. GHCJS will work with more Haskell
packages than Haste, but this doesn't affect a lot of frontend
projects. PureScript isn't Haskell at all, so direct code sharing with your
backend will not work.

GHCJS has the fattest runtime payload overhead at about 100kb (luite is working
on this). Haste and PureScript are competitive.

PureScript has the best JS tooling integration (uses gulp/grunt/bower), GHCJS
and Haste integrate better with Haskell's tooling (Cabal).

All three are great choices and will work for most frontend projects.

# Lenses and Prisms

After you're comfortable with Haskell, strongly consider learning Lenses and
Prisms, even if just as a "user". You don't need to understand the underlying
category for it to be useful.

People vastly overestimate the difficulty of using Lens. Anybody comfortable
with Functor/Foldable/Traversable (or even just the first one) can leverage
lenses and prisms to make their life happier.

If you've ever done something like: `(fmap . fmap)` you were "lensing" in your
head.

I recommend these two tutorials/introductions:

- [A little lens starter tutorial](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/a-little-lens-starter-tutorial)

- [Lens: Lenses, Folds and Traversals](https://github.com/ekmett/lens#lens-lenses-folds-and-traversals)

Look here for more information: [Lens package on hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens).

# Recursion Schemes

Some of the crazy \*-morphism words you've heard are actually about
recursion. NB - before tackling this material you should know how to implement
foldr for lists and at least one other data structure, such as a tree. (folds
are catamorphisms) Knowing how to implement an unfold (anamorphism) for the same
will round things out a bit.

This material dovetails with traversable and foldable.
